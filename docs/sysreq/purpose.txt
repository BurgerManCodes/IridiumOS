Sysreq's purpose is for device interaction or just interacting with a general user API.
NOTE: You can only sysreq devices that are has it's 
driver non-claimable (i.e not in the claimable list [see kernel/include/proc/drvmaster.h]).

Anything in the claimable list can only be used by a process that has PPERM_DRVCLAIM and that has claimed 
the driver.


Again, sysreq can be used for either talking to a device or using some service 
non related to device interaction.
