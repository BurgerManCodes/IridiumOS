Terminology:

- Driver category/driver type.
    A group of drivers with a similar purpose.

- sys-daemon
    A system process that keeps something working.

- Claimable driver
    A driver that either needs a little much of internal knowlage or one
    that is not as safe to use directly from userspace, thus it is 'claimable' (by daemons with PPERM_DRVCLAIM)
    and can be interacted with by a drvmaster's interface.

- Drvmaster
    A daemon that has claimed a driver.
